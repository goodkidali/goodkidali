<p>
 Hello! My name is Ali Saheb and I am an aspiring Software Engineer. I am currently in my 3rd year studying at Lassonde School of Engineering, York University - (B.Eng) Spec. Hons. Software Engineering.

I like to make random projects in a wide variety of languages to explore the world of coding and further my knowledge and understanding of programming & software development.

I am very interested in technology and love to learn new languages and techniques/algorithms to increase my efficiency and expertise in this field. I am a dedicated and motivated learner/worker
and strive to go above and beyond expectations.
